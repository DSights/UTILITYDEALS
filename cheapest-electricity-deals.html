                    What can I do to lower my electricity bill?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can compare your tariff and see what’s the cheapest & best deal available in your area .You can use Utility Deals’ energy bill comparison tool, to figure out the best way to reduce your electricity bill.
                </p>
                <p class="font-x1 mt-3">
                    Why should I compare electricity tariffs?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being a loyal customer doesn’t always mean you’ll be given the cheapest energy prices. So, if you haven’t switched your electricity supplier or plan for a year or so, most probably you are paying more than needed and you could be on a standard tariff, which is more expensive then a fixed tariff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It takes only few minutes to compare electric tariffs & ensures that you get the cheapest and best available electricity deal.
                </p>
                <p class="font-x1 mt-3">
                    How do I find the cheapest electricity supplier?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure you compare electricity prices regularly to ensure you’re on the best available deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; The type of meter you have <br>
                    &bull; Type of tariff you prefer (fixed or variable)<br>
                    &bull; Your consumption levels <br>
                    &bull; Your Postcode <br>
                    &bull; Whether you’d like your electricity to be renewable
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it’s been a while since you switched, you’re more likely to be on your supplier’s standard variable tariff, which is typically the most expensive type of plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cheapest electricity tariffs can be found by switching to a fixed deal.
                </p>

                    How long does it take to switch to the best energy supplier via Utility Deals?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Switching electricity provider takes two-six weeks but it depends on various factors. Why don’t you leave it for our money saving experts to do the task on your behalf, so you could focus on what matters you most.  
                </p>
                <p class="font-x1 mt-3">
                    Will switching electricity suppliers lead to an interruption in my supply?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not at all. Your new electricity supplier will be using exactly the same infrastructure, wires, pipes and meters that’s been currently used by you (unless you’ve arranged to install a new smart meter by your new supplier, then they would send an engineer to come and install a smart meter with a minimum inconvenience to you). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Switching to a cheap electricity supplier isn’t about getting a physically different supply – the only thing that changes is that they’re issued by a different supplier & you’ll get cheaper electricity bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your new electricity supplier will also contact your existing supplier to arrange the transfer to ensure there is no disruption to your service.
                </p>
                <p class="font-x1 mt-3">
                    Will I be charged an early exit fees if I switch energy supplier?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early exit fees may apply only when you switch your energy supplier before your existing contract with the old supplier has not ended. Especially, if you have a fixed tariff.
                </p>
                <p class="font-x1 mt-3">
                   Does cheap electricity mean poor customer service?
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, switching to a cheap electricity tariff doesn’t mean you’re compromising on customer service. 
                </p>

                                Renewable energy is produced from natural resources that aren’t depleted when used. It’s the preferred energy option for the future both in Australia and around the world, mainly because it won’t run out, unlike coal and other fossil fuels. As renewable energy doesn’t contribute to carbon emissions, it also won’t negatively affect climate change as significantly.

                                There are a variety of renewable energy sources. Solar power is one of the most well-known, wind power is one of the most widespread, and hydropower is one of the oldest. There are also other renewable technologies becoming available that harness geothermal energy or ocean energy to produce heat and electricity.

                                Solar power is a common form of renewable energy, generated from the sun’s heat or from sunlight. Captured through the use of solar panels, often on the roofs of residential and commercial properties, the energy produced is converted into electricity or used to heat air, water, and to power homes, businesses, and batteries.

                                More than two million Australian households have a solar system on their rooftop for electricity generation, although there are a variety of other ways that solar energy can be harnessed. These include:

                                How much you’re paying for electricity and what’s causing your bill to skyrocket each month can seem like a difficult puzzle to figure out. But thankfully, there’s a simple formula to help you calculate your electricity costs from watts. All it takes is the following steps:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Find out how much you pay per unit of electricity. This is usually calculated in kilowatts per hour (kWh) and is typically found on your bill. There may be different rates for peak and off-peak usage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Determine how much input power your appliances are using. This information is often found on the packaging or in the instruction manual in watts. Convert this to kilowatts.

                                Multiply the input power in kW by the price of your electricity per kilowatt hour (kWh). As an example, 3kW (appliance input power) x 30c per kWh (cost of electricity per hour) = 90c per hour to use that appliance.

                                There are a multitude of reasons for rising electricity prices in Australia. One of the main ones has been the need to invest in maintaining and improving the network infrastructure in order to increase capacity in a growing population. Another factor has been the need to address environmental issues, which means minimising the use of coal plants and creating more renewable energy sources.

                                Utilities are services that are typically required for the home or office to function, such as electricity, gas, and water. In some cases, they may also include council rates (such as street cleaning, rubbish disposal, etc.), as well as telecommunications services.

                                 Depending on which state you live in, there may be additional taxes or levies for your utilities. For example, in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), your telecommunications bill is also considered a utility and is charged through the Utilities Network Facilities Tax.

                                 If you’re on a pension and receive a payment from Centrelink, there may be cases where you’re entitled to a discount on your utility bills. You can find out more on the Department of Human Services website.

                                Smart meters are designed to measure and record your electricity usage. This data is then transmitted every 30 minutes to your electricity distributors (the company that owns and maintains the grid, poles, and wires). Your energy provider also receives the data and may make it available to you via a web portal or app, allowing you to monitor your energy consumption, better manage your costs, and compare different offers that may be more suitable.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                 It also allows your meter to be remotely read by your provider, which means no more estimated bills. It can quickly notify your distributor if there’s a power outage, which means the problem can be located faster, repair crews can be allocated quicker, and repairs can begin sooner.

                                Companies and organisations in Australia and around the world are trying to reduce their carbon footprints to help address increasing environmental concerns. One way many are doing this is by aiming to become carbon neutral. This is when an entity’s net greenhouse gas emissions are equal to zero.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                 Achieving this requires a company to reduce their emissions as much as possible, and then purchase carbon offsets equivalent to the remaining emissions. This allows them to contribute to a range of social, environmental and economic outcomes, such as providing employment for local communities and supporting the maintenance of habit for native animal and plant species.
