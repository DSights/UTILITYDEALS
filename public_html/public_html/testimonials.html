                            Utility deals managed to find the best deal for gas &AMP; electricity which has resulted in huge savings compared to what was being offered by the previous provider. The staff are very friendly and helpful who go out of their way to ensure full customer satisfaction.

                            Frank from Utility Deals carried out a free review of our gas/electric & water bills and saw that our current gas/electric supplier, Scottish Power, had provided renewal rates for both – he secured much lower rates and fixed them for us for 3 years. He also reviewed the club’s annual water cost and secured substantial savings for the club here as well, once again fixed for 3 years. The customer service from Frank and his company has been faultless. I’m more than happy to recommend to any business or organisation. First class!

                            I couldn’t understand how my monthly gas/electric costs had suddenly shot up. Frank (Utility Deals) reviewed my bills and immediately told me that he thought I was being massively overcharged. He requested tapes of the sales conversations from Opus Energy – they didn’t even go that far, saying that they had found an ‘anomaly’ and that they would cancel both contracts – Frank then secured excellent gas/electric rates and fixed them for 3 years for me. He’s now dealing with the Ombudsman on my behalf to try to recoup the monies I’ve been overcharged. I really can’t thank him and his company enough, not only for reducing my rates so dramatically but for his patience throughout. I would say to any other business at least let him review your bills – if you’re on a good deal he’ll say so, if he can achieve better, believe me, he will. Utility Deals also saved us money on our water.

                            Frank- Utility Deals was recommended to us by a friend whose pub he had helped save money on gas & electric. He reviewed our bills, queried the VAT we were being charged (he’s now sorted this for us), looked at the renewal rates we were being offered by our current supplier and came back with much lower rates, fixed for 3 years. He has provided the best customer service we’ve had from any previous energy supplier and, because he’s locally based, he’s always happy to answer any queries we may have and he pops in periodically just to see that things are running smoothly. I can’t recommend Utility Deals highly enough.

He did a thorough review of our gas, electric & water bills and our annual usage on all three and came up with really impressive rates on all of them, which he fixed for us for a number of years.

Utility Deals also got us a great deal on our home gas & electric. Frank compared gas & electric rates on his computer while he was with us and showed us what was available from a lot of energy companies – we’re really pleased with the rates and the customer service he always provides – we’ve recommended Utility Deals to other businesses we know.

                            Frank carried out a review of our gas & electric bills/charges, ran comparisons and secured some excellent rates for the Mosque on both; the rates secured in advance and fixed for a number of years. He also reviewed our water and secured a large annual saving (fixed for 3 years) for us here as well. I have no hesitation in recommending his services.

                            Having dealt with a number of the 'leading'(🤣) energy brokers - whose sales people (I've been told this first-hand) are instructed to 'price-condition' - prepare them to be offered outrageously high rates - and who use 'closers' to push as high a rate as possible onto the clients...Utility-Deals.com are a breath of fresh air. Rates that are generally lower than the rates businesses are currently on or the renewal rates their suppliers are offering, no 'closers' or price-conditioning and superb customer service.
